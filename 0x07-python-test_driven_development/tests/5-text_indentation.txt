The ``5-text_indentation`` module
======================

Using ``text_indentation``
-------------------
This is a test document based on 5-text_indentation.py
Each '>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.

        >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
